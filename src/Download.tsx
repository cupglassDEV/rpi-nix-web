    <p>Currently, theres no way to download this. You need to build it from <b>yourself</b>ðŸ˜‰, heres why</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My Github Action seems to use the old phase of the build, i already make so many breaking changes to my nix flake</li>
        <li>Phasing out to a separate repo for distribution, or else you got a whopping 12gb on each version</li>
        <li>As i remember, github dosent really allow these isos to distribute to github. But what if actually Github Action build these things, then just commit them. It wouldnt be illegal, right? Its <i>on their own machine</i>, idc</li>
    </ul>
